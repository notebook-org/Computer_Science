# Software versioning
1. [Semantic Versioning](./Semantic%20Versioning/index.md)

Process of assigning either **unique version names** or **unique version numbers** to unique states of computer software.

Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemes:
  1. **Internal version number**
    - That may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number
  2. **Release version**
    - That typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning
