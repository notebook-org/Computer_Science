# Logging
This module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for applications and libraries.

## Basic Logging Tutorial
* Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs.
* An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data.
* Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event
  * The importance can also be called the level or severity.
* Logging provides a set of convenience functions for simple logging usage.
  * These are debug(), info(), warning(), error() and critical().
