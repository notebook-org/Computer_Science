# QDialog

A QDialog widget presents a top level window mostly used to collect response from the user.

It can be configured to be Modal (where it blocks its parent window) or Modeless (the dialog window can be bypassed).

PyQt API has a number of preconfigured Dialog widgets such as InputDialog, FileDialog, FontDialog, etc.
